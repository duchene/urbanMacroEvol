The data used for analyses can be loaded into R using the *load* function.

Once the data have been loaded. The following data frame elements will be found:

*dcol1* and *dcol2* are tables with the data used, with and without the data for brain size, respectively. Each of the tables is associated with a phylogenetic tree object, named *trcol1*, *trcol2*.

In addition, the elements *noto_obs* and *sscd_obs* contain the statistcs of the tests perfromed using the phylometrics package, with *P*-values contained in the *notoless* and *sscdgrea* elements. The elements *datfpd* and *datfpdurban* contain the results of analyses performed using the caper package.
